# Open-Loop Buck Converter Schematic
![Open Loop Buck Converter Schematic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/015f98d1-8c74-4325-b3e9-fbde7168edf2)
This are the schematic of the open-loop buck converter simulation with the specifications :
Vin = 24V and targeted Vout = 12V ; Switching frequency (fs) = 50kHz
with Output Power (P) = 60W resulting in Iout = 5A; 
L = 80uH ; C = 33uF

# Voltage Waveform and Measurement (open loop)
![Voltage Waveform](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08f104fb-4c71-40fd-bdc0-dfe0bccb3825)

![Voltage Measurement](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54f57344-45a7-4002-b885-c76431799ccb)

the output voltage is settled on an average of 11.987V and still on the tolerated ripple of 1%.

![Current Measurement](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ba360f0-e57b-414a-87b3-85047b136255)

the relative ripple from the simulation result is still on the tolerated value (<30%) and indicating the inductor value is correct and suitable for the design
