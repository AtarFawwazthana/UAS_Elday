This repository containing the report and simulation of Buck Converter and PV grid-connected Inverter from the Elektronika Daya Take Home Exam

![Open Loop Buck Converter Schematic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/015f98d1-8c74-4325-b3e9-fbde7168edf2)
This are the schematic of the open-loop buck converter simulation with the specifications :
Vin = 24V and targeted Vout = 12V
Switching frequency (fs) = 50kHz
Output Power (P) = 60W resulting in Iout = 5A
L = 80uH ; C = 33uF
